# Divide and Conquer

These are my solutions to week 4 of the [Coursera Algorithmic Toolbox course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox), which is part of the [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms).

* Implementation of the Quicksort algorithm
* Find the Majority Element of an array

The solutions are written in functional scala as I was trying to improve my functional programming and scala skills when I wrote these.
